# Fashion-Wear-Classification-

We propose a method of classifying fashion-wear based on apparels and their patterns using deep learning . This helps in providing high-level features for clothing and can be used for matching user preferences. We obtained an accuracy of 91% using Convolutional Neural Networks. We use fashion mnist dataset that contain 10 differnt classes. The Fashion MNIST training set contains 60,000 examples, and the test set contains 10,000 examples.
